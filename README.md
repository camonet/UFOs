# UFOs

## Overview of Project
### Languages used: Javascript, HTML-8, CSS
The purpose of this analysis was to enable additional filtering options for the UFO sighting data. The filters added were city, state, and country of the sighting, and shape of the UFO. The filtering options are able to work for the same search as well, offering increased specificity of sighting searches. 

## Results
Previously, the UFO sightings website was only able to fulter by sighting date, in the form of MM/DD/YYYY. The new filtering interface is displayed as follows,

where the new filtering options are present with example placeholders in the correct search format. 

A filtered search would bring up only the corresponding results, shown below:

## Summary
The analysis was performed using javascript, html, and css languages. One drawback of this design is that the website interface does not tell the user if the filter input is available. For example, if someone put in a date that wasnt in the dataset, there would be no error message. Two recommendations for further development of this interactive website would be to add error messages, as well as connect the website to a continuously updating database to show nore recent sightings. Another helpful interactive tool would be to filter by "most recent", or "oldest", instead of specific dates. Adding a map of all the sightings would be an interesting visual element as well.
